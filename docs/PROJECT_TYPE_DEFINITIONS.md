# Project Type Definitions (`getProjectTypeClass()`)

This document serves as the official technical specification for project classification within the portfolio's data layer. These tags are utilized by the `getProjectTypeClass()` function in `script.js` to dynamically inject CSS classes, providing visual context and filtering capabilities to the Project Gallery.

## Classification Logic

The taxonomy is divided into four primary categories: **Engagement Model**, **Technical Stack**, **Development Context**, and **Visual Focus**.

### 1. Engagement & Status Tags

Used to identify the professional origin or current state of the project.

| Tag                    | Definition                                                                        |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`client-based`**     | Projects built for external clients under contract or freelance agreements.       |
| **`experience-based`** | Work completed during formal employment, internships, or professional coursework. |
| **`sale`**             | Commercial products or templates ready for purchase or licensing.                 |
| **`maintenance`**      | Live projects receiving ongoing updates, bug fixes, or feature expansions.        |
| **`archive`**          | Discontinued or legacy projects kept for historical reference.                    |
| **`featured`**         | High-priority entries highlighted for exceptional skill or innovation.            |

### 2. Technical Stack Tags

Identifies the core architectural layer of the application.

| Tag             | Definition                                                                |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`frontend`**  | Focused on client-side logic: HTML, CSS, JS, React, or Vue.               |
| **`backend`**   | Focused on server-side logic: Node.js, Express, APIs, and Databases.      |
| **`fullstack`** | Comprehensive solutions covering both Frontend and Backend architectures. |
| **`devops`**    | Infrastructure-focused: CI/CD, Docker, Kubernetes, or Cloud Automation.   |
| **`micro`**     | Small-scale utilities or widgets solving a single, specific task.         |

### 3. Development Context Tags

Describes the "Why" and "How" behind the project's creation.

| Tag               | Definition                                                                             |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`personal`**    | Self-initiated research and development for skill acquisition.                         |
| **`team`**        | Collaborative efforts emphasizing version control and team-based workflows.            |
| **`solo`**        | Independently developed projects showcasing end-to-end problem solving.                |
| **`clone`**       | Recreations of existing platforms (e.g., Netflix, Spotify) for architectural practice. |
| **`educational`** | Projects built for teaching, tutorials, bootcamps, or academic labs.                   |
| **`demo`**        | Rapid prototypes or "Proof of Concept" (PoC) builds to showcase a specific feature.    |
| **`template`**    | Reusable boilerplate code or layouts intended for rapid deployment.                    |

### 4. Design & Visual Tags

Specifically for projects where the aesthetic or user-flow is the primary deliverable.

| Tag                    | Definition                                                              |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`ui-ux`**            | Emphasis on layout, user journey, accessibility, and visual hierarchy.  |
| **`design-prototype`** | High-fidelity mockups or interactive wireframes built in Figma or code. |

## 🛠 Technical Implementation

### CSS Variable Integration

Each class generated by `getProjectTypeClass()` should correspond to a specific color variant in `style.css` to maintain the **Gold/Dark Glassmorphism** theme.

```css
/* Example Styling in style.css */
.tag-fullstack {
  background: rgba(212, 175, 55, 0.2);
  color: var(--accent-dark);
}
.tag-client-based {
  border: 1px solid var(--accent-dark);
}
.tag-featured {
  box-shadow: 0 0 15px var(--shadow-color);
}
```

### Script Usage

In `script.js`, ensure the `type` array utilizes the exact strings defined above:

```javascript
// Example Project Object
{
  id: "pro-001",
  title: "AI Task Manager",
  type: ["fullstack", "featured", "solo"], // Uses defined tags
  // ... rest of data
}

```

## Usage Notes

1. **Case Sensitivity:** The `getProjectTypeClass()` function is case-sensitive. Always use lowercase strings in the `type` array.
2. **Tag Limits:** It is recommended to use **2-4 tags** per project to maintain UI cleanliness within the project cards.
3. **Consistency:** Before adding a new custom tag, check if one of the 20 definitions above already covers the use case to ensure the filtering logic remains robust.
